packaging for styles from http://www.zurb.com/article/266/super-awesome-buttons-with-css3-and-rgba, with some helpers

note that this is in no way official, these styles are property of zurb, I am not an employee of zurb, and this is subject to whatever license they happen to choose (currently there is a blog comment saying feel free to use these in your projects)
